Pizzerium
=======

![](http://i.imgur.com/HSlNDwo.jpg)

A Ruby on Rails app for reviewing pizzerias.

The Pizzerium is a Launch Academy Group Project.
We implemented a rating system for pizzerias by slice, upvote/downvotes, user sign-up and authentification (Devise), (image uploads Carrierwave), search, email, pagination, and admin namespacing.
